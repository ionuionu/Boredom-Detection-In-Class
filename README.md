Boredom-Detection-In-Class
==========================

This is a research project and it aims at detecting boredom in class. Lets start discussing the science of boredom. Our aim was to build a real time application that could detect measure boredom in class/ attentiveness of the class. Boredom is a very abstract term. It is very difficult to describe what exactly boredom is. After abstracting the word to maximum extent, discussing with the Professor and digging in the literature we could come to common grounds on the following signs :
1) Yawning
2) Drowsing
3) Distraction

Boredom is a complex emotional state and is very hard to reliably detect and distinguish from other emotional states that have commonalities with boredom like indifference and depression. A bored person exhibit many signs when bored and even though the origin of these signs might be misinterpreted, they should be very well possible to detect. In this way a very well educated guess may be formed on whether a subject is bored.
